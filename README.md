### Hi there, I'm [Sraya_Goldfisher][website] ðŸ‘‹

## I'm An experienced mechanical-robotics engineer with demonstrated expertise in R&D of delicate robotics and vehicles

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working @[ZUtA_Labs][company]
- ðŸ’¬ I really enjoy from robotics R&D projects 
      and if you're working on interesting Robotics projects 
      and looking for help\guidance, I'm always happy to talk!
- ðŸŒ± As a childhood robotics enthusiast with a great passion for the field, 
      it was like going to Disneyland when I began my studies for a Robotics Engineer's degree. 
      It was such an incredible experience to experiment and learn so many areas - 
      such as mechanical and robotic design, drawings and analyzes in SolidWorks, 
      MATLAB and Gazebo simulations, electrical circuit design, 
      and code programming for control and navigation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Getting to work on the different robotics projects has really been a dream come true, 
      and I can't wait for what the future holds.
